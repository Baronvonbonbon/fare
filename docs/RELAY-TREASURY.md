# Relay treasury — fee coverage + auto fee-recovery swaps (Hydration/XCM)

## The finding: the gasless-order test did NOT confirm the fee covers gas

Two reasons:

1. **The e2e bypassed the guard.** `scripts/e2e-gasless.mjs` submitted the
   forwarded order + settlement **directly from the relay wallet**, not through
   the venue-node's `/forward` + `/submit` endpoints — so `economics.mjs`'s
   profitability guard never ran.
2. **Currency mismatch — the guard couldn't have decided anyway.** For a **token**
   order the F6 rebate is paid in the **order token** (USDC, 6-dp) while gas is
   spent in **native** (PAS, 18-dp). The old `coversCost(reward, cost)` compared
   them as one unit. Concretely, that order:
   - relay **spent** ~**0.088 PAS** gas (create 38 794 + accept 6 930 + pickup
     16 106 + dropoff 25 791, at 1000 gwei),
   - relay **earned** **0.01875 USDC** (F6 rebate at the raised `relayRebateBps`),

   and whether the second covers the first depends entirely on the **PAS↔USDC
   price**. At, say, 1 USDC = 0.5 PAS the rebate is 0.009375 PAS — it does **not**
   cover 0.088 PAS. **So no, coverage is not confirmed; it's a price question.**

This is exactly why the relay earning USDC but burning PAS needs a **swap**: its
native balance only ever drops. The swap closes the loop, and the swap *quote* is
the price the guard needs.

## Fix 1 — currency-aware profitability guard (shipped)

`economics.tokenToNativeWei(tokenWei, tokenDecimals, nativeDecimals, priceNum,
priceDen)` values a token amount in native wei (pure integer math). The relay's
`rebateForOrder` now:

- native order → rebate is already native, unchanged;
- **token order → rebate valued in native** via the price
  (`RELAY_TOKEN_PRICE`, or a live Hydration quote), then compared to native gas;
- **no price → returns `null` → the guard DECLINES** the settlement (it cannot
  prove the fee covers gas) rather than guessing.

So the relay now correctly refuses to settle a token order at a loss, and
`relayRebateBps` can be sized against real gas at the real price. Unit-tested
(`economics.test.mjs`, `treasury.test.mjs`; 27 pass).

## Fix 2 — auto fee-recovery swaps (venue-node/treasury.mjs)

When native gas dips below a floor, swap accrued **token fees → native** so the
relay refuels itself. Design + pure logic shipped (`shouldTopUp`, `planSwap`,
`priceFraction`, `topUpCycle` — tested); live execution gated.

**Target (verified reachable):**
- **Hydration Paseo testnet** — `wss://paseo-rpc.play.hydration.cloud`.
- **Paraspell XCM Router** — supports **Paseo + Hydration** swaps (Polkadot/
  Kusama/Paseo/Westend; 8 DEXes, testnet-capable).
- **Asset Hub EVM XCM precompile** — Asset Hub pallet-revive exposes XCM-category
  precompiles, so the relay's **existing EVM key** can `send` the swap XCM (the
  chosen signer model — no separate substrate key). Paraspell builds the route/
  quote; the precompile submits.

**Flow:** relay gas < floor → withdraw accrued token fees → Paraspell quote
(USDC→native, also feeds Fix 1's price) → `planSwap` (reach target, keep a native
reserve for XCM fees, skip dust) → XCM: Asset Hub → Hydration omnipool swap →
back to the relay on Asset Hub.

### The one hard prerequisite (why it's not live yet)

**The fee token must be a real Asset Hub *asset*** (pallet-assets, seen from EVM
via its ERC-20 precompile) to be **XCM-transferable**. Our accepted stablecoin is
an **EVM-only MockUSDC** — it **cannot** be XCM'd to Hydration. So on Paseo the
live swap needs the accepted stablecoin swapped to a genuine Asset Hub asset
(e.g. the Paseo USDC/USDT asset via its precompile). Until then, `executeSwap`
throws an explicit error (it never silently no-ops moving money), the pricing +
planning run and are tested, and `RELAY_TOKEN_PRICE` feeds the guard.

**Progress (2026-07-24):** real Asset Hub USDC (**asset 1337**, ERC-20 precompile
`0x0000053900000000000000000000000001200000`, 6-dp) is **accepted** as a FARE
escrow token on the upgraded orders — it exists on Passet Hub (~250M supply) and,
being a real pallet-assets asset, is **XCM-transferable** (unlike MockUSDC). USDt
(asset 1984) `0x000007C000000000000000000000000001200000` is also present. Two
caveats found: (a) the precompile is a **bare IERC20 — no `permit()`** even on
mainnet, so real-asset gasless orders use the **approve path**, not
`createOrderERC20WithPermit`; (b) **no open faucet** on Passet Hub (deployer
balance 0) — sourcing a balance needs the Hydration Discord faucet (`/drip`, on
Hydration's testnet) or a PAS→stablecoin swap. `scripts/hydration-swap.mjs` is the
test script for the latter (Paraspell XCM Router; quote mode is read-only, swap
mode needs a funded substrate sr25519 signer). Note: Paraspell's Hydration
exchange needs `@galacticcouncil/api-augment` + deduped `@polkadot/types`.

**To go live:** (1) accept a real Asset Hub asset as the FARE stablecoin;
(2) `npm i @paraspell/xcm-router` (+ its Wasm/augment deps) in `venue-node`;
(3) verify the Asset Hub XCM-precompile interface + wire `executeSwap` to build
via Paraspell and submit via the precompile from the relay account; (4) set
`SWAP_ENABLED=on` + the gas thresholds.

## Better path found: swap LOCALLY on Asset Hub's native DEX (no XCM)

Investigating "run the swap through Paseo" surfaced a simpler answer than the
Hydration/XCM round-trip:

- **FARE's chain (chainId 420420417) IS Paseo Asset Hub** — Paraspell's
  `AssetHubPaseo` (by mid-2026 Paseo Asset Hub runs pallet-revive; the earlier
  "Passet Hub is a separate isolated chain" worry was wrong). So it's a fully
  XCM-/DEX-routable chain, not an island.
- **Paseo Asset Hub has a NATIVE DEX** — Paraspell lists `AssetHubPaseoDex` (the
  `asset-conversion` pallet). So **PAS ↔ USDC can swap on FARE's own chain, with
  no XCM, no Hydration, and no mod-gated Discord.** This is the cleanest
  fee-recovery *and* balance-sourcing path, and it's the mainnet answer too
  (Polkadot Asset Hub has `asset-conversion`).
- **The XCM precompile** (for the cross-chain fallback) is at
  `0x00000000000000000000000000000000000a0000` — `execute(bytes,Weight)` /
  `send(bytes,bytes)` / `weighMessage(bytes)`, SCALE-encoded messages.
- **The Paseo faucet is OPEN** (Matrix/web, per-parachain target) — unlike
  Hydration's Discord `/drip` (mod-gated). It funds PAS, which the local DEX then
  swaps to USDC.

**Recommended pivot:** target the **local `asset-conversion` DEX** for PAS↔USDC
instead of Hydration/XCM. Two things to confirm/build: (1) a PAS↔USDC pool with
liquidity on the Paseo AH `asset-conversion` DEX (Paraspell's live calls hang on
testnet RPC — query the pallet directly with polkadot-api, or the DEX precompile
if one is exposed); (2) execution — an `asset-conversion` precompile callable from
the EVM relay (local swap, no XCM precompile needed) if it exists, else a
Paseo-faucet-funded substrate signer. `scripts/hydration-swap.mjs` keeps the
Hydration route as the cross-chain fallback (identifiers: `AssetHubPaseo`,
exchange `HydrationDex`; needs `@galacticcouncil/api-augment` + a `@polkadot/types`
dedupe, and the Hydration testnet RPC is flaky).

## Sufficient assets + the local DEX — VALIDATED on-chain (2026-07-24)

Queried Paseo Asset Hub directly (`@polkadot/api`, WSS `asset-hub-paseo-rpc.n.dwellir.com`):

- **USDC (1337) and USDt (1984) are `isSufficient = true`** (minBalance 0.07). A
  sufficient asset can **instantiate an account and (via `asset-conversion`) pay
  fees with no native token**. → a FARE burner can hold **only USDC**, no PAS ED.
- **PAS↔USDC and PAS↔USDt pools exist** on the native `asset-conversion` DEX
  (lpTokens 9 and 5 of 20 pools). `quotePriceExactTokensForTokens` returns a live
  price: **1 USDC = 0.2496 PAS** (1 PAS = 3.98 USDC; PAS is 10-dp on substrate).
  Wired as `treasury.assetConversionQuote(assetId)` — the recommended price source
  (replaces the flaky Hydration quote), read-only, no signer.

### Coverage verdict — at the REAL price, the current fee does NOT cover gas
The gasless order: relay spent ~0.088 PAS gas (≈ **0.35 USDC**) and earned
**0.01875 USDC** (5000-bps rebate on the tiny fare). So the fee covers **~5% of
gas** — the relay is deeply underwater on small orders. A percentage rebate on a
sub-dollar fare can't cover a fixed-ish gas cost. **Fix the fee model**, not just
the price: a **flat/minimum relay fee** per order (in USDC), or eliminate the
relay-gas problem entirely (next point).

### The bigger lever: sufficient-asset fee payment (verify for EVM)
Because USDC is sufficient, `asset-conversion` can charge **fees in USDC**,
auto-converting to native. If **pallet-revive EVM txs** support this
(`ChargeAssetTxPayment` / a paymaster over `eth_transact`) then a burner **pays
its own gas in USDC** and the relay/forwarder + fee-recovery swap are **unnecessary
for the currency problem**. The docs are silent on EVM fee-in-asset — this is the
single most valuable thing to confirm (pallet-revive runtime config). If it works,
FARE's gasless model simplifies dramatically.

### Recommendations (priority order)
1. **Verify EVM fee-in-asset** (sufficient-asset paymaster over pallet-revive). If
   yes → burners pay gas in USDC; drop the relay-gas machinery.
2. **If not** → keep the relay, but **price the rebate at the live pool rate**
   (`assetConversionQuote`) and switch to a **flat/minimum relay fee** so it
   actually covers gas; recover fees via the **local `asset-conversion` swap**
   (execution: an asset-conversion precompile from EVM if one exists — TBD probe —
   else a Paseo-faucet-funded substrate signer). No XCM/Hydration/Discord.
3. **Broaden payments**: accept **USDt (1984)** too (also sufficient; pool exists)
   — a one-line `setAcceptedToken`.
4. Drop the Hydration/XCM path to a documented fallback (cross-chain only).
