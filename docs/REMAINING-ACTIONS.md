# FARE — Remaining Actions

One consolidated, actionable view of what's left, pulled from the per-feature
docs and the [integration-plan board](PRODUCT-INTEGRATION-PLAN.md). Grouped by
*what kind of work it is*, most-actionable first.

Legend: ☐ not started · 🟡 partial (verifiable core built, rest deferred) · 🔒 mainnet gate.

> **Live status (Paseo, 2026-07-22).** Full protocol deployed + seeded, now
> including **F6 (relay gas-rebate)** and **F8 (EIP-2771 forwarder + gasless
> withdraw)**. Migrated via `scripts/upgrade-f6-f8.ts` (freeze-and-drain).
> Current addresses: forwarder `0x57C7…97FCe`, vault `0x9f03…C0Ea` (old vault
> kept live for drain), orders `0x7e73…B32e`, settlement `0xC560…25a8E`, ratings
> `0xa854…73D6` — see `deployed-addresses.json`. Fees on-chain:
> `relayRebateBps=2000`, `withdrawFeeBps=100`. **Gasless UX is deployed but

## 1. Operational — make the live demo fully work (no new code)

The full protocol (incl. F6/F8) is deployed + seeded on Paseo. Remaining ops:

- ☐ **Run a venue relay (this is what turns gasless ON)** — run `venue-node/`
  with a funded `RELAY_PRIVATE_KEY`, then either build the app with
  `VITE_RELAY_URL=…` or advertise `PUBLIC_RELAY` from the agent's manifest (the
  client discovers it). The forwarder + gasless-withdraw vault are already live,
  so a running relay immediately makes placeBid / cancels / rate / withdraw
  gasless. **Note the profitability guard:** with real (tiny) testnet fares the
  relay will *decline* settlement (rebate ≪ gas) and the app prompts "pay your
  own gas?"; set `RELAY_PROFIT_GUARD=off` for a fully-gasless demo, or raise
  `relayRebateBps`/`feeBps`. See [venue-node/README](../venue-node/README.md).
- ☐ **Faucet secret** — set `DRIP_PRIVATE_KEY` (funded) in Cloudflare Pages env so
  `/api/drip` funds burners on demand (the "one manual secret step"). Without it,
  gas top-ups fall back to the public faucet. (Auto-drip on connect was removed;
  value actions ensure gas on demand, non-value actions go gasless via the relay.)
- ☐ **IPFS (optional, shared menus)** — stand up the DATUM node + set
  `IPFS_ADD_URL` / `IPFS_API_KEY` / `VITE_IPFS_GATEWAY`. Without it, published
  menus are device-local (`local://`), single-device only.
- ☐ **Channel KV (optional; chat / tracking / photo)** — bind `MSG_KV` and
  `PHOTO_KV` namespaces in Cloudflare Pages (Settings → Functions → KV) so
  `/api/msg` and `/api/photo` back the order channel + delivery-photo store.
  Without them, these need a running venue relay (`/msg`, `/photo`) or degrade.
- ✅ **Cloudflare Pages rebuild** auto-triggers on push to `main` (address books
  committed); the client also re-resolves upgraded contracts from the router at
  runtime.
- ✅ Deployment + seed + **F6/F8 migration** done (15 contracts live; venues #1–2;
  demo order re-seeded on the new orders).

## 2. Feature follow-ons (🟡 — core built, infra/UI deferred)

Each has a verified core already committed; the remaining half is the deferred
infra/UI, spec'd in the linked design note.

- ✅ **B3 Messaging** — **shipped.** E2E crypto (`web/src/msg.ts`) + the **relay
  channel** (`web/src/channel.ts`: per-order `topic=H(orderId)`, KV relay
  `/api/msg` P1 → venue-node `/msg` P2) + an authenticated hello handshake +
  `ChatPanel` in the customer & driver order cards. Integration-tested
  (`channel.test.ts`). **Ops:** bind a `MSG_KV` namespace in Cloudflare Pages (or
  a venue relay serves it). See [MESSAGING.md](MESSAGING.md).
- ✅ **B2 Live tracking** — **shipped.** The driver opt-in shares live location
  (`TrackPublisher`), E2E-sealed as `kind:"loc"` envelopes over the channel
  (never on-chain, only the customer can decrypt); the customer's `TrackPanel`
  renders the driver + venue + a trace on a tile-less `TrackMap` with distance +
  a rough ETA. Round-trip integration-tested (`channel.test.ts`). Preserves the
  "driver location stays off-chain" invariant — sharing is consensual + E2E.
- ✅ **B6 Proof-of-delivery photo** — **shipped.** Driver captures →
  `compressImage` (downscale + EXIF-strip) → crypto-shred seal (`photo.ts`) →
  `storeSealed` (content-addressed `/api/photo` KV, venue `/photo` fallback) →
  `sendPhoto` wraps the key E2E over the channel (`kind:"photo"`); the customer's
  `TrackPanel` fetches, decrypts, and views it. Expires by storage TTL (~2 wk)
  ∧ crypto-shred. Round-trip tested. Remaining niceties: swap the demo store for
  Bulletin Chain `store` when live; a proactive local key-purge. See [PHOTOS.md](PHOTOS.md).
- ✅ **C1 / F8 Gasless relay** — `venue-node/` relay (gas sponsorship + settlement
  relay) **and** the EIP-2771 forwarder: `FareForwarder` + `_msgSender()` in
  `FareOrders`/`FareRatings` make the **non-value** user actions (placeBid /
  withdrawBid / cancels / rate) gasless via the relay's `/forward`. Value actions
  (createOrder / acceptBid / increaseTip) stay on the gas-sponsored funded-burner
  path so the relay never fronts escrow. **PWA wired** (`web/src/relay.ts`
  `relayForward` — the app signs a `ForwardRequest` and posts it to `/forward`
  when a forwarder is deployed + a relay is available, else falls back to direct
  calls). **Relay discovery:** the agent advertises `services.relayUrl` in its
  region manifest (`PUBLIC_RELAY`); the client learns a relay pool and prefers the
  discovered region relay over the build-time `VITE_RELAY_URL` (DATUM `relayUrl`
  pattern). **Gasless earnings:** `FareVault.withdrawFor` (driver-signed, relay-
  submitted, `withdrawFeeBps` reimburses the relay) lets a driver cash out with
  zero gas — `relayWithdraw` in the app + `/withdraw` on the relay.
  **Profitability guard:** the relay estimates gas and only sponsors a
  reward-bearing action when the fee reward covers the fare's cumulative relayed
  cost × margin (`venue-node/economics.mjs`); no-reward actions run under a gas
  budget; declines return 402 → the app prompts "pay your own gas?"
  (`RELAY_PROFIT_GUARD=off` to disable). **Deployed live on Paseo** (forwarder +
  migrated vault). Remaining: only **run a relay** to activate it (§1).

## 3. Not started (☐)

**Group B — product**
- 🟡 **B4 Notifications** — **P1 shipped** (`web/src/notify.ts` + order-diff hook +
  a 🔔 permission bell): local notifications on relevant order transitions
  (assigned / picked up / delivered / bid-accepted / new nearby order), foreground
  only, no server/keys/identity. **P2 spec'd** ([NOTIFICATIONS.md](NOTIFICATIONS.md)):
  true background push via VAPID + the **venue-node relay as a per-device,
  region-filtered push service** (chain-event-triggered) — no "AVIDITY"/Parity
  native push exists, and Push-Protocol's wallet-linked model is rejected (would
  re-link burners).

**Group C — payments / economics**
- ☐ **C2 Fiat-denominated pricing** — quote in local currency, settle at an oracle
  rate captured at acceptance.
- ☐ **C3 Stablecoin escrow** — Asset Hub USDC/USDT via the ERC-20 precompile; an
  ERC-20 variant of `FareVault`.
- 🔒 **C4 Shielded funding** for per-order burners — see §4.

**Group D — ops / governance console** (⚙️ deliberately out of the consumer PWA)
- ☐ **D1 Arbiter console** — dispute queue + `resolve` (customerShareBps, openerWins, slash).
- ☐ **D2 Governance console** — `setParams` / `setGeoParams` / `setMinStake` / `setDisputeBond` / `setArbiter`.
- ☐ **D3 Guardian pause console** — `pause` / `unpause` / `setGuardian`.
- ☐ **D4 Upgrade console** — router `register` / `upgradeContract` / `setContractFrozen`.

**Group E — trust & release**
- ☐ **E1 Filmed end-to-end field test** (two phones, one real handoff) — R1's key artifact.
- 🟡 **E2 Slither / Mythril** static-analysis pass — **Slither done + in CI** (`.github/workflows/slither.yml`, `crytic/slither-action`); full triage in [SECURITY-REVIEW.md](SECURITY-REVIEW.md) (96 results, **zero high-severity**; new F6/F8 surface clean). Mythril documented as an on-demand deep-dive for money-handling contracts (too slow to gate CI).
- ☐ **E3 External audit** before mainnet value.
- ☐ **E4 Device-attestation tier** (Play Integrity / App Attest), L0/L1/L2 gradient.

**Group F — venues-as-infrastructure** (design in [NETWORK-ARCHITECTURE.md](NETWORK-ARCHITECTURE.md))
- ✅ **F1 `VenueMetadataUpdated` event** — `setMetadata` now emits it (+ test); event-driven menu-update replication unblocked.
- ✅ **F2 Venue appliance** — `venue-node/` Docker Compose (Kubo + agent + relay + Caddy). Remaining: **run it** on a venue box, and an optional `pine-rpc` light-client container (folded into F4).
- ✅ **F3 Replication agent** — `venue-node/agent.mjs`: chain-indexed region pinning + region-manifest publish, re-pins on `VenueMetadataUpdated`.
- ✅ **F4 Client gateway/RPC fallback pool** — gateway pool (`web/src/pool.ts`): the client learns venue/region IPFS gateways from manifests as it loads menus. RPC-provider pool (`web/src/rpcpool.ts`, wired in `chain.ts`): venue RPCs augment reads only in hosted mode as lower-priority fallbacks behind the hosted anchor, and broadcasts fan out to several endpoints — the in-app light client stays the trustless primary, venue RPC never a sole read path (§4/§5). Both tested.
- ✅ **F5 Data-availability scoring** — `venue-node/scorer.mjs`: challenge-response (random byte-range vs. CID-canonical content) + decayed client reports → per-node score + leaderboard. Feeds F6.
- 🟡 **F6 On-chain rewards** — Tier 1 **LIVE on Paseo**: **trustless relay gas-rebate** (`relayRebateBps` in `FareOrders`, + test). A governed share of the protocol fee is carved to the account that submits the dropoff tx (the relay that fronted gas), self-identified via `msg.sender` — no oracle, no new cost to orders, escrow math exact. Deployed with `relayRebateBps=2000` (20% of the fee). Remaining: **Tier 2 DA-score reward** (`FareDataAvailability` + a trusted attester to bring F5 scores on-chain) — **deferred, no oracles for now**; token emission intentionally out of MVP.
- ✅ **F7 Hosted super-node mode** — one appliance serves many venues by setting `HOME_COORDS` to a list of centers; the agent pins the union of their regions (+ tests). The relay is already region-agnostic, and the hosted `/api/menu` publish path exists, so non-technical venues need no box of their own.

## 4. 🔒 Mainnet gates (hard prerequisites)

Do NOT ship for real value until all hold. Privacy is largely closed already
(ZK dropoff, driver-coord scrub, per-order burners); what remains:

- 🔒 **Real MPC trusted-setup ceremony** before `setVerifyingKey` (lock-once). The
  shipped setup is single-party — fine for testnet, not mainnet.
- 🔒 **Shielded funding path** for per-order burner wallets (C4). Faucet-funded
  burners are unlinkable *only* on testnet (shared faucet); on mainnet, funding
  from a real wallet re-links them. Needs a mixer / shielded pool / relayer-funded
  meta-txs.
- 🔒 **External audit** (E3) + fuzz/invariant coverage (✅ started, `test/invariant.test.ts`) + static analysis (✅ Slither in CI, [SECURITY-REVIEW.md](SECURITY-REVIEW.md)).
- 🔒 **Stablecoin escrow** (C3) — food margins can't absorb DOT volatility.
